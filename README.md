# 🚀 My Personal TurboRepo for Framework Practice

Welcome to my **TurboRepo setup** where I've brought together multiple modern web frameworks in a single monorepo environment. This repo serves as my **personal development playground** to explore, build, and experiment with the best frontend technologies out there.

---

## 📦 What's Inside?

This monorepo includes:

- ⚡ **Next.js** – for React-based full-stack applications
- 🧩 **Angular** – for enterprise-grade frontend architecture
- 🌱 **Vue.js** – for fast and flexible UI building

Each app is set up in its own directory under `apps/`, configured with shared packages via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

---

## 🛠️ Why This Repo?

> Practice makes perfect. This TurboRepo helps me **learn by doing**, all in one powerful monorepo setup.

With this repo, I can:
- Compare framework conventions side-by-side
- Reuse shared utilities and components
- Understand how each ecosystem handles routing, state, and structure
- Improve build speed and dev workflows using `turbo`

## 🌟 Inspired By

This project is **inspired by [Aiyeola's GitHub](https://github.com/aiyeola)** – a developer whose style and learning approach motivated me to start my own centralized framework playground.
